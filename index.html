			<p1>You are walking down the street on your way to the bakery to buy a delicious <i>cream filled frosted donut</i> as you always do on your lunch break; your pockets feel light but you know you have just enough money saved to afford the delicious treat. As you are walking you come across a homeless man resting at the side of path you are on. As you pass you hear him say something you can't quite make out. You reach into your pocket assuming he wants some change, it turns out you only have a single pound coin; the same price as your favourite donut. </p1>
