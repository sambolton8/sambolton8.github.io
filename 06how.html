				You ask how we can get past the monster...

				<p>
I’m not sure… exactly. My thoughts were that we take a shot at climbing those rocks together in the cove. Maybe we could even try to scrap together some rope from seaweed now that you’re here to help. I’m not sure there's any way of getting past it though. Unless of course you want to try and kill it, in which case you're on your own.
